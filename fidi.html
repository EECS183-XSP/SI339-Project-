		<h1>Financial District</h1>
        <p> This area was one of the first places I visited when we first moved to New York.
            My aunt worked on Beaver street and we had some friends that lived nearby. Now that 
            I am a business student, it seems like I will always have ties to FiDi.

            The first restaurant I wanted to showcase here, is Tacombi! The food here is always amazing and 
            they have a huge selection of vegeterian options as well.

                     Baja Crispy Fish Taco ($6.49), Carnitas Taco ($4.49), and their Gringa Quesadilla ($8.95). If you are over the age of 
                     21, the restaurant also has some good cocktail options, inclduing their $55 margrita pitchers. </p>

                Hole in the Wall has some of my favorite classic on their menu. I like to get Wild Mushroom Toast ($19), the Chili Scrambled 
                Eggs ($17), or the Fried Chicken Sandwich ($18). They also have a great coffee bar, they serve smoothies and drinks as well!
